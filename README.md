# Weather App

This project's goal is to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using the Open Weather API ðŸŒ¤

## The problem

We have used JavScript's fetch() method to get all the data we need from the Open Weather API ðŸŒ¦ This is our first time working with an API, so we learned about understanding its documentation and the different parameters in its URL.
Learned about promises and how to extract the data from JSON object ðŸ’ª
We also learned about styling in javascript and dared to try animation effects for the icons and background.
